# IRC(s)ERV

IRCerv is a pure java implementation of IRC server as described in [RFC1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) and later. 

# INSTALL
You can use our ircerv.jar to run the server on any host with JVM of 6 or above. We plan to add port as a parameter if you are not happy with default (localhost:9999). 

To start our server run with your favourite command line  `JAVA -JAR IRCERV.JAR`
